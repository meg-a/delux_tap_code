# delux_tap_code
We developed our own tap code system from the original tap code.

This program allows you to use tap code to write text. In other words, if you use this program, YOU ONLY NEED LEFT SHIFT 
KEY TO TYPE IN WORDS. 

In tap code, message is transmitted through a series of tap sounds. 

When you run the program, a window that contains tap code will appear. 

The table at the bottom of the window shows you the combination of our tap code. You can refer to the table when typing 
texts. 

To start writing texts, you first press left shift button to input row number. For example, if you want to type letter 
'B', you first tap shift one time.
*Each tap must be less than 0.5 seconds in order to input row number. 

If you are finished with inputting the row number, you then press shift more than 0.5 seconds. 

You are now able to input column number. Similar to when you inputted the row number, you press left shift. If you want to 
type letter 'B', then this time, you tap shift two times.

If you are done, press shift for more than 0.5 seconds. 

The program will read the completed text which is also presented at the top of the window.

If you want to continue typing, go through the same cycle of inputting row then column. 

When you want to delete one letter from your completed text, tap 6 times, then 3 times as shown on the table. 
*you can't use 'delete' when there's only one letter in your completed text which is shown at the top of the window.
